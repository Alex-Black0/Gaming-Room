The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements
The client, The Gaming Room, is a company focused on developing multi-platform gaming applications. Their flagship game, Draw It or Lose It, is a team-based, multi-user game that was originally developed for Android systems. They wanted to expand the game to other operating platforms, including web and desktop environments. The software requirements included creating a scalable application that supports multiple game instances, maintains unique identifiers for players and teams, and ensures secure communication across platforms.

What I Did Well
In developing the software design document, I excelled in clearly articulating the technical details in a manner accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I thoroughly addressed The Gaming Room's requirements by analyzing the platforms and proposing practical solutions for memory management, storage management, and distributed systems. My ability to recommend scalable cloud-based solutions and integrate security measures into the design demonstrates a strong grasp of both technical and client-focused needs.

Helpful Aspects of the Design Document Process
Working through the design document helped me structure my approach to coding and project development. It required me to think critically about the architectural decisions and how each component interacts with others. By identifying key requirements like scalability and security early, I could better plan the code structure and ensure the final implementation aligned with the client’s expectations. This documentation also served as a valuable reference during coding, helping me maintain consistency and focus.

Areas for Improvement
If I were to revise one part of the documentation, I would improve the "Storage Management" section. While it adequately addressed the use of hybrid storage solutions, I could have included more details on performance metrics and data redundancy strategies to ensure reliability. Adding specific examples, such as the use of RAID configurations or multi-region cloud storage, would make the recommendations more robust and actionable.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
To interpret the user’s needs, I focused on their goal to expand Draw It or Lose It to multiple platforms while maintaining a seamless user experience. I translated their requirements into technical solutions, such as proposing a web-based architecture using REST APIs for communication and emphasizing security through encryption and role-based access control. Considering user needs is critical to ensuring the software meets expectations and provides a positive experience, which ultimately determines the success of the application.

Approach to Designing Software
My approach to designing software involved breaking the project into smaller components, analyzing each one, and integrating them into a cohesive system. For example, I used UML diagrams to visualize relationships between entities and identified appropriate design patterns like Singleton and Iterator to streamline functionality. In the future, I would continue to use this modular approach, incorporating additional strategies such as prototyping and iterative feedback from stakeholders to refine the design further.

Conclusion
The software design document for Draw It or Lose It serves as a comprehensive blueprint for developing a scalable, secure, and user-focused gaming application. By adhering to best practices in software design and keeping the client’s needs at the forefront, this project has not only demonstrated my technical skills but also my ability to communicate effectively with diverse stakeholders.
